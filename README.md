Run `truffle migrate --network matic` to deploy to Mumbai testnet (https://explorer-mumbai.maticvigil.com/)

To fork a local version of Mumbai testnet on your local machine, run `ganache-cli -f https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/<PROJECTID> -m "soda decline delay save reform embrace bunker web liberty toward rebuild member" -i 1` (the seed phrase is a fake one!!)
Then run `truffle migrate` to deploy to the forked testnet
